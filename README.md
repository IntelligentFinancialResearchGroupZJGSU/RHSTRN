üìñAbstractÔºö

 Stock Trend Prediction (STP), which aims to anticipate future price movements of equities, is inherently difficult due
 to market volatility, regime shifts, and complex temporal dependencies. Despite recent advances, existing methods still
 struggle with the non-stationarity and dynamic dependencies of financial markets, often overlooking the variability
 of financial indicators and leading to unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose RHSTRN, Robust Hierarchi
cal Spatio-Temporal Representation Network that dynamically captures evolving relationships among stocks while
 mitigating the effects of market noise and fluctuations. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively balances ro
bustness and adaptiveness, effectively handling both noisy inputs and complex dependencies in financial data. Exten
sive experiments on real-world stock datasets demonstrate that RHSTRN consistently outperforms existing methods,
 achieving state-of-the-art performance in stock trend prediction
 
üìñKey contributions:

We design the ARG module to adaptively select
 high-impact features by integrating insights from
 the efficient market hypothesis and behavioral fi
nance, systematically filtering multidimensional
 signals to enhance prediction reliability and model
 interpretability.
 
 ‚Ä¢ An RDG module is proposed, which decomposes
 input signals into low-rank and sparse components
 (L +S) to construct a richer and more robust stock
 relationship graph, capturing both stable and tran
sient inter-stock dependencies to better model mo
mentum spillover effects.

 ‚Ä¢ Complex inter-stock interactions and sequential
 dynamics are modeled by jointly learning spa
tial and temporal embeddings via the HRSE and
 HTE, which are integrated into the proposed Ro
bust Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Representation
 Network (RHSTRN) to enhance STP.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Experimental results show that RHSTRN con
sistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines,
 demonstrating strong empirical performance and
 practical applicability across different trading sce
narios.
